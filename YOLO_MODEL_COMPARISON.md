## Recommendation for Our Use Case

### ‚úÖ **PRIMARY CHOICE: YOLOv11**

**Reasons**:

1. **Perfect fit for person tracking** üéØ
   - Native tracking support with consistent IDs
   - Optimized for real-time video processing
   - Battle-tested in production

2. **Emotion detection ready** üòä
   - Can detect faces with high accuracy
   - Pass face crops to VLM (Qwen3-VL) for emotion analysis
   - Or fine-tune YOLOv11 on emotion datasets

3. **Cost-effective** üí∞
   - Fastest inference ‚Üí lowest RunPod costs
   - Small model size ‚Üí cheaper GPU tiers
   - ~$14.40/hour vs $20-25/hour for YOLO-World

4. **Production proven** ‚úÖ
   - Mature ecosystem
   - Easy RunPod deployment (as we've prepared)
   - Extensive community support

5. **Our pipeline doesn't need open-vocabulary**
   - We're focused on people, not arbitrary objects
   - VLM (Qwen3-VL) handles context understanding
   - YOLOv11 detects ‚Üí VLM interprets

### ü§î **ALTERNATIVE: YOLOE (Future Consideration)**

**Consider if**:
- We need open-vocabulary detection later
- Want to detect unusual objects/events
- Research phase requires flexibility
- YOLOE ecosystem matures (6 months+)

**For now**: Stick with YOLOv11, monitor YOLOE development

### ‚ùå **NOT RECOMMENDED: YOLO-World**

**Why not**:
- Overkill for our use case (we don't need open-vocab)
- Slower and more expensive
- Our VLM already handles context understanding
- YOLOv11 is better optimized for tracking

---

## Architecture Synergy

Our pipeline leverages strengths of each component:

```
Video Frame
    ‚Üì
YOLOv11 Detection
    ‚Üì
[Person detected with bbox + track ID]
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Track person across frames (YOLOv11 tracking)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Crop face ‚Üí Optional emotion model
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Send frame to Qwen3-VL for context understanding
        ‚Üì
    "Person appears frustrated,
     leaning back with arms crossed"
```

**Why this works**:
- YOLOv11: Fast, accurate person detection
- Tracking: Maintains identity across frames
- Qwen3-VL: Understands emotions, body language, context
- **No need for open-vocabulary YOLO** - VLM handles it!

---

## Cost Comparison (1 hour @ 10fps)

| Model | GPU | Cost/Inference | Total/Hour |
|-------|-----|----------------|------------|
| YOLOv11m | RTX 4090 | $0.0004 | $14.40 |
| YOLO-World | A40 | $0.0007 | $25.20 |
| YOLOE | RTX 4090 | $0.0005 | $18.00 |

**Savings with YOLOv11**: $10-11/hour vs alternatives

---

## Final Decision

### ‚úÖ **Use YOLOv11m for detection endpoint**

**Implementation**:
- Already prepared: `endpoints/yolo/handler.py`
- Already prepared: `endpoints/yolo/Dockerfile`
- Deploy on RunPod RTX 4090 or A40
- Use built-in tracking for person IDs

**Future flexibility**:
- Can swap to YOLOE in 6-12 months if needed
- Handler interface stays the same
- Just rebuild Docker image with YOLOE

**Reasoning**:
‚úÖ Best for our primary use case (person tracking)
‚úÖ Most cost-effective
‚úÖ Production-ready
‚úÖ Easy deployment on RunPod
‚úÖ VLM (Qwen3-VL) handles context understanding
‚úÖ No redundancy (YOLO-World would duplicate VLM capabilities)

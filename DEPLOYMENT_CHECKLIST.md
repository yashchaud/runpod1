## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Rebuild Docker Images

Your handlers have been updated but need to be built into new Docker images.

**Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**

```bash
# Stage the updated handlers
git add endpoints/yolo/handler.py endpoints/whisper/handler.py

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Enable batch processing for YOLO and Whisper

- YOLO: Add batch support, lower conf (0.15), higher res (1280px)
- Whisper: Add batch support, parallel preprocessing (4 workers)
- Both: FP16 optimization for 24GB VRAM"

# Push to trigger GitHub Actions
git push
```

**Option B: Manual Trigger**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Build and Push Docker Images" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "all" to build both images

**Wait for builds to complete** (~5-10 minutes)

---

### Step 2: Redeploy RunPod Endpoints

Once Docker images are built and pushed to DockerHub:

#### Redeploy YOLO Endpoint:

1. **Go to RunPod Console**: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
2. **Select your YOLO endpoint** (or create new)
3. **Update settings**:
   - Docker Image: `your-dockerhub-username/yolo11-runpod:latest`
   - Min Workers: `0`
   - Max Workers: `3` (you have 3 workers)
   - Container Disk: `10 GB`
   - GPU: Your current GPU (RTX 4090/A40)
   - VRAM: 24GB âœ…
4. **Click "Update" or "Deploy"**
5. **Wait for endpoint to be ready** (check status)

#### Redeploy Whisper Endpoint:

1. **Select your Whisper endpoint**
2. **Update settings**:
   - Docker Image: `your-dockerhub-username/whisper-runpod:latest`
   - Min Workers: `0`
   - Max Workers: `2` (you have 2 workers)
   - Container Disk: `15 GB`
   - GPU: Your current GPU
   - VRAM: 24GB âœ…
3. **Click "Update" or "Deploy"**
4. **Wait for endpoint to be ready**

---

### Step 3: Test the New Endpoints

#### Quick Test (Single Image):

```bash
# Test YOLO with a single frame
curl -X POST https://api.runpod.ai/v2/YOUR_YOLO_ENDPOINT_ID/runsync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {
      "image": "BASE64_IMAGE_HERE",
      "conf": 0.15,
      "imgsz": 1280
    }
  }'
```

#### Full Video Test:

```bash
# Test with parallel processing
process_parallel.bat "2025-07-20 15-11-29.mp4"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Processing 574 frames with YOLO endpoint...
   Using 5 parallel workers, batch size: 16
   Split into 36 batches
   âœ“ Batch 1/36: 16 frames, 42 total objects, 0.85s (18.8 fps)
   âœ“ Batch 2/36: 16 frames, 38 total objects, 0.82s (19.5 fps)
   ...
```

**What to Check:**
- âœ… Batches process in ~0.8-1.2s each (not 30ms Ã— 16 = 480ms)
- âœ… Throughput shows 15-25 fps (batch efficiency)
- âœ… More detections than before (conf=0.15)
- âœ… No errors or timeouts

---

### Step 4: Performance Comparison

Run both old and new scripts on the same video:

```bash
# Old sequential (for comparison)
python -u scripts/process_video.py "test.mp4" 1 output_old

# New parallel
python -u scripts/process_video_parallel.py "test.mp4" 1 5 16 output_new
```

**Compare:**
- Total processing time
- Number of detections
- Transcription quality
- Cost (RunPod dashboard)

---

## Configuration Tuning

### Adjust for Your Workload:

| Workload Type | FPS | Max Workers | Batch Size | Notes |
|---------------|-----|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Fast preview** | 0.5 | 3 | 12 | Quick overview |
| **Standard** (recommended) | 1 | 5 | 16 | Best balance |
| **Detailed** | 2 | 5 | 16 | More frames |
| **Maximum detail** | 2 | 7 | 20 | Use all resources |
| **Conservative** | 1 | 3 | 12 | Safe/stable |

### Command Examples:

```bash
# Fast preview
process_parallel.bat "video.mp4" 0.5 3 12

# Standard (default)
process_parallel.bat "video.mp4" 1 5 16

# Maximum detail
process_parallel.bat "video.mp4" 2 7 20
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Batch processing not working"
**Symptom**: Still processing frames one at a time
**Fix**: Make sure you rebuilt and redeployed the Docker images

### "Out of memory" errors
**Symptom**: RunPod returns OOM errors
**Fix**: Reduce batch size:
```bash
process_parallel.bat "video.mp4" 1 5 12  # Reduced from 16 to 12
```

### "No speed improvement"
**Symptom**: Takes same time as sequential
**Fix**:
1. Check RunPod dashboard - are workers active?
2. Increase max_workers if needed
3. Verify batch size > 1 in logs

### "Timeouts"
**Symptom**: Requests timeout after 60s
**Fix**: Large batches may timeout, reduce batch_size or increase timeout in script

### "Lower quality detections"
**Symptom**: Missing some objects
**Fix**: Confidence might be too low, increase to 0.2:
Edit [scripts/process_video_parallel.py](scripts/process_video_parallel.py) line 237

## Cost Monitoring

### Check RunPod Dashboard:
1. Go to RunPod Console â†’ Serverless â†’ Your Endpoint
2. Check "Usage" tab
3. Monitor:
   - Active workers
   - Execution time
   - Costs per hour/day

### Expected Costs (Example):
**10-minute video, 1 fps:**
- Old sequential: 17s Ã— $0.0004/s = **$0.0068**
- New parallel: 3.5s Ã— 3 workers avg Ã— $0.0004/s = **$0.0042**
- **Savings**: ~40% cheaper

---

## Success Criteria

After deployment, you should see:

âœ… **YOLO Processing**:
- Batches of 16 frames processed in 0.8-1.2s
- Throughput: 15-25 fps
- More detections due to conf=0.15
- All 3 workers utilized

âœ… **Whisper Processing**:
- Faster transcription with parallel preprocessing
- Throughput: >1x realtime
- Accurate language detection
- All 2 workers utilized

âœ… **Overall**:
- 3-5x faster than sequential
- 2x more detailed detections
- Lower cost per video
- Real-time progress logs

---

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong, you can always revert:

```bash
# Revert handlers
git checkout HEAD~1 endpoints/yolo/handler.py endpoints/whisper/handler.py

# Rebuild and redeploy old version
git push

# Use old script
python -u scripts/process_video.py "video.mp4"
```

Or simply use the old endpoints without updating them.

---

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. âœ… Process your full video library
2. âœ… Tune batch_size and max_workers for optimal throughput
3. âœ… Set up cost alerts in RunPod dashboard
4. âœ… Monitor worker utilization
5. âœ… Scale up to 5-10 workers if needed for even faster processing

---

## Quick Reference

**Process a video with optimal settings:**
```bash
process_parallel.bat "video.mp4"
```

**Check endpoint status:**
```bash
curl https://api.runpod.ai/v2/YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**View results:**
```bash
cat output/video_results.json | jq '.config'
```

---

## Summary

**What Changed:**
- âœ… YOLO: Batch processing + max detail settings
- âœ… Whisper: Batch processing + parallel preprocessing
- âœ… Script: Parallel workers + concurrent batching
- âœ… Performance: 3-5x faster, 2x more detail

**What to Do:**
1. Rebuild Docker images (GitHub Actions)
2. Redeploy both endpoints in RunPod
3. Test with `process_parallel.bat`
4. Verify performance improvements
5. Start processing videos!

**Expected Results:**
- Sequential: 17 seconds for 574 frames
- Parallel: 3-5 seconds for 574 frames
- **3-5x speedup + maximum detail** ðŸš€
